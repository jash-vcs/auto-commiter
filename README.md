# Code-Tracking README  

Code-Tracking is a VS Code extension that tracks all code changes in your workspace over a defined interval (default: 30 minutes) and automatically commits those changes with AI-generated commit messages using Gemini AI. It helps developers keep a seamless version history without the hassle of manual Git operations.

## Features  

- **Automatic Change Tracking**: Detects file changes, additions, and deletions in real time.  
- **AI-Generated Commit Messages**: Uses Gemini AI to generate concise and relevant commit messages summarizing the work done in the interval.  
- **Customizable Time Intervals**: Automatically commits changes every 30 minutes (default), which can be adjusted in the code.
